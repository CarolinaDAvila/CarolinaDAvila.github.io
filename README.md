Hi! 
I'm a full-stack Software Engineer based in New York City with experience in JavaScript/Node.js, Ruby, SQL, Go, AWS, Docker,and React.
Recently, I created [Firefly](https://try-firefly.github.io/), an open-source observability framework, providing a comprehensive overview of serverless function health through the use of metrics and traces.
